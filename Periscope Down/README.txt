Attention (player) all hands,
You are aboard a submarine (the oval) hiding under the surface of the sea,
reaching the right side of the screen to find safer waters. 

Beware of the sea mines (grey squares) on the screen, hit 3 and you will be too damaged to keep going. 

At which point the submarine surfaces (the oval is bigger) 
making it harder to see the mines (the mines opacity is turned down) 
and you, the player, no longer have control of the submarine. 

When any of these things happen or the right side is reached please refresh the page. 

Use the Y key as forward, B key as Backward, slide down the T F V keys to turn left and the U J N keys to turn right. 

For the best experience full screen the tab then hit refresh. 
Enjoy the high seas
